I know it's a bit late to talk about resolutions for this year. Still, I wouldn't have done justice to mine without giving them deep, deliberate thought.

This year I am not chasing new systems. I already have good ones.

The real bottleneck is **feeling good enough, often enough, to keep showing up** - long enough for the benefits to compound.

So my resolutions for 2026 are about consistency, identity, and removing friction.
Less _what am I trying_, more _who am I becoming_.

## 1. I am a disciplined observer of my own life
Idea: Journal everything extensively

By the end of 2026
- I have a searchable personal knowledge base of thoughts, decisions, emotions, and experiments.

Non-negotiables
- Weekly review every Sunday (fixed 30-60 minutes block), honest summary - wins, frictions etc.
- One monthly "life memo" (what changed, what stayed)

## 2. I live like a warrior - with the calm of a saint
Idea: Habits of body + mind + spirit
I am not trying to copy athletes or monks; I am **borrowing their constraints**.

Verse from Gita ji:

**"र्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन |<br/>
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि || २-४७ ||"**

(Literal gist): Your right is to the action alone, never to the fruits of action; let not the fruits be your motive, and do not be attached to inaction.

By the end of 2026
- Food fuels performance, not mood
- Training is scheduled, not optional
- The mind has a daily stillness practice
- Gita ji becomes a lived philosophy, not a ritual checkbox

## 3. I am a calm, high-leverage professional
Idea: Non-emotional at work + technical depth

By the end of 2026
- I respond, not react. (I give myself time to remove emotional reactivity and prioritise clarity)
- I am known for clarity, not urgency
- I compound technical skill quietly and consistently

## 4. I am a builder-in-public
Idea: Blog / learning-in-public / vlog (not sure at the moment)

By the end of 2026
- My thinking is documented enough that opportunities find me
- I have visible proof-of-work and a track record of finishing projects
- Quality over quantity, but consistency over silence

## 5. I am designing my future, not drifting into it
Idea: Be deliberate about life-choices

By the end of 2026
- I've prioritised research, outreach and prototyping
- I've clarity on next-steps, even if the answer is "not yet"

## 6. How I'll keep track (cadence & accountability)
I am keeping accountability simple so it's sustainable and honest.
- Daily micro-checks (1-2 minutes): a tiny one-line note with today's one focus and a quick check for training and stillness. This is low fiction - just to preserve continuity and make the Sunday review easier.
- Sunday review (weekly, 30-60 minutes): the main operational cadence. Every Sunday I review the week's micro-checks, log compliance, note patterns (energy, food, focus), and pick one experiment tweak for the coming week (if needed). I block this time on my calendar so it's non-negotiable.
- Monthly review (monthly, 45-60 minutes): the accountability artefact. Each month I write a concise "life memo" summarising numbers, headline insight, wins, frictions, identity checks, experiment results, and three non-negotiable for the next month. This is the post I keep for myself - and selectively share when it's useful as proof-of-work.
- Signals I'll watch: training sessions completed, stillness minutes, journal days completed, technical hours, public outputs, and one life-experiment milestone. I'll track them at a glance in the weekly and monthly reviews - no spreadsheet / obsidian complexity unless I want it.

## Note to myself
The point isn't perfection.

The point is to build identity-level habits with low friction and a singular focus on observing reality as it is - so showing up becomes the default, not the exception. 

If I can keep my calendar honest, make Sunday review sacred, and distill each month into one clear memo, the long game will take care of the rest.
