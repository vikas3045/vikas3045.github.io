Starting today, I’ll be doing a deep-dive review of the popular Python library, [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). My goal is to thoroughly explore the codebase and document my observations incrementally in this new category on my blog. 

In general, I’m calling this series [requests-sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#requests-sticky-notes), which will serve as a space for all sort of less formal posts — short text entries, quick notes, or bullet points relevant to this exploration. 

In fact, I am starting the category of [sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#sticky-notes) in general to hold all sort of quick and dirty notes/quick-bites eventually to be turned into or aggregated into something more formal, comprehensive and polished article.

In this spirit, eventually, once I have enough material, I plan to consolidate these `requests` related notes into a comprehensive, polished article.

I’m calling this series [requests-sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#requests-sticky-notes). It will serve as a space for less formal posts — including short text entries, quick notes, or bullet points — specifically related to this exploration. 

To support this approach, I’m also introducing a broader category called [sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#sticky-notes), which will be a repository for quick, unpolished ideas or "quick bites." Over time, these notes can be refined or aggregated into more formal and comprehensive articles.

In the same spirit, once I’ve accumulated enough material, I plan to consolidate these `requests`-related notes into a polished, in-depth article.
