Starting today, I’ll be doing a deep-dive review of the popular Python library, [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). My goal is to thoroughly explore its codebase and document my observations incrementally in a new category on my blog. 

I’m calling this series [requests-sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#requests-sticky-notes). It will serve as a space for less formal posts — including short text entries, quick notes, or bullet points — specifically related to this exploration. 

To support this approach, I’m also introducing a broader category called [sticky-notes](https://vikassharma.me/categories#sticky-notes), which will be a repository for quick, unpolished ideas or "quick bites." Over time, these notes can be refined or aggregated into more formal and comprehensive articles.

In the same spirit, once I’ve accumulated enough material, I plan to consolidate these `requests`-related notes into a polished, in-depth article.
