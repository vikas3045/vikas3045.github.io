Happy New Year 2025!

It's been a while since I posted anything on this blog. In fact, I didn't manage to publish any articles at all last year. Looking back, I realize there are quite a few drafts still sitting in my `_drafts` folder, waiting to see the light of day. However, `2024` was quite different, marked by the ups and downs it brought into my life.

`2023` will undoubtedly be remembered for the wave of mass layoffs. Unfortunately, my job was also made redundant in November 2023. To say the least, the job market was extremely challenging at that time. However, the unexpected free time made me more appreciative of the small joys in lifeâ€”things we often overlook in the daily hustle. 

Then came `2024`. I started a new job in an entirely new countryâ€”Singapore. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the move. But as time went on, I began to enjoy the work environment and the overall experience. In many ways, last year was about overcoming setbacks and rebuilding my life. Most importantly, it was about regaining a positive outlook. So, part of the reason for not posting anything on the blog can be attributed to the sheer amount of change I was navigating (thankfully, all positive in the end).

On the health front, I built some great habits, including running and working out regularly. I think there's something about Singapore that inspiresâ€”or perhaps nudgesâ€”you to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Work-wise, itâ€™s been a fulfilling year. Iâ€™ve been able to contribute meaningfully toward achieving my team's goals. 

On a broader note, Iâ€™m very optimistic about the advancements in AI, especially in the realm of large language models. I believe `2025` will be a year of diving deeper into this fascinating field (better late than never, right?).

Looking ahead, I also want to be more consistent with posting articles and notes on this blog in `2025`. Lately, Iâ€™ve been inspired by [Simon's blog](https://simonwillison.net/), and I hope to emulate some of that regularity and insightfulness.

Hereâ€™s to hoping for the best. From here, the only way is upwards and onwards.

LFG ðŸ’ª

Happy New Year once again!
