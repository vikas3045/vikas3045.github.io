Continuing the study of the `requests` module. Today, I am diving into `requests/hooks.py`, a lightweight but powerful module that allows users to attach custom logic to the request/response lifecycle.

## Key Concepts in `requests/hooks.py`
### Purpose
Hooks provide a way to execute user-defined functions during specific parts of the requests/response lifecycle. This makes it possible to customize or extend the behavior of `requests` without modifying its core code.

### Hook Events
- The primary hook event is `response`, which lets you manipulate or inspect the `Response` object before it is returned to the user.

### Structure of Hooks
`default_hooks`: Defines the default structure of hooks.

```python
default_hooks = {'response': []}
```
Each key corresponds to a specific lifecycle event, and the value is a list of functions to be executed.

### Dispatching Hooks
`dispatch_hooks`: This function executes all functions associated with a specific hook.

```python
def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs):
    if hooks.get(key):
        for hook in hooks[key]:
            hook_data = hook(hook_data, **kwargs)
    return hook_data
```

- `key`: The hook event (e.g., `'response'`).
- `hooks`: A dictionary containing user-defined hooks.
- `hook_data`: The data passed to the hook (e.g., a `Response` object).
- `kwargs`: Optional additional arguments.


### Using Hooks with `Response`
Hooks are typically used to inspect or modify a `Response` before it's returned to the user. For example:

```python
import requests

def response_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
    print(f'Hook: Status Code - {response.status_code}')
    return response

hooks = {'response': [response_hook]}
response = requests.get('https://example.com', hooks=hooks)
```
- The `response_hook` function runs after the request is completed but before the `Response` is returned.
- You can add multiple hooks to the `response` event, and they will be executed in order.
